	<h1>my extemely limited linux 5.15.55 kerel</h1>
	<p>
		click <a href="bzImage">here</a> to download the bzImage of the
		kernel. I also made a very minimal
		<a href="initramfs.cpio">initramfs</a> which prints 'Hello' over
		and over again so it can be run in qemu. To run everything in
		qemu, run <span style="font-family: monospace;">
		qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel bzImage -initrd initramfs.cpio
		-append "root=/dev/ram init=/init"</span>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		I also wrote a longer explanation of how I compiled this kernel
		from my mac. You can find it <a href="README.md">here</a>, but
		it's fairly long and written in plaintext markdown.
